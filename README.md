# GWO-based-MPPT
In this project, a GWO-based maximum power tracking (MPPT) algorithm for PV systems operating under partial shading conditions (PSCs) is proposed.
With a direct control method, the proposed GWO-based MPPT allows successfully catching the global maximum power point (GMPP) of the PV array in case
of uniform and non-uniform solar irradiation. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MPPT scheme, a simulation in Matlab/Simulinkâ„¢ environments
is carried out and tested under various static and dynamic shading conditions. Furthermore, the tracking performance is compared with that of the particle
swarm optimization (PSO) and classical perturb and observe (P&O) based MPPT methods under transient PSCs and also under inhomogeneous real conditions of
Algerian sky. The simulation results have demonstrated the satisfactory performances of the proposed approach in terms of tracking efficiency and tracking
speed over the other MPPT methods.
